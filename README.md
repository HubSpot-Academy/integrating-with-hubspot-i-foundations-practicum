# Welcome to the Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations Practicum

This repository is for the Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations course. This practicum is one of two requirements for receiving your Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations certification. You must also take the exam and receive a passing grade (at least 75%).

To read the full directions, please go to the [practicum instructions](https://app.hubspot.com/academy/l/tracks/1092124/1093824/5493?language=en).

**Put your HubSpot developer test account custom objects URL link here:**
I'm posting only a link to contacts as I'm unable to access custom objects on my test account. Here's a reply from the professor:

> Hello Dominik,

> I've looked into your test account you created. Unfortunately, it seems as if your HubSpot account isn't on Marketing Hub Enterprise, which is required for custom objects. Due to this, I will return to my team to discuss how to make our practicum more inclusive of those who don't have access to them.

> For now, you can complete the practicum by calling a standard object that comes within your CRM (contact, company, etc). Please let me know if that makes sense to you.

> Best,
> Brooke Bond, Developer Professor
